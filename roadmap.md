# Roadmap
1. Read the problem situation
2. Understand and discuss the issue
3. Define the ultimate deliverable
4. Form a hypothesis
5. Acquire the data
6. Perform exploratory data analysis
7. Clean the data
8. Mine the data: format, slice, combine data
9. Refine: identify trends or outliers, apply inferential statistics
10. Build a model, then fine tune it
11. Present results


# The Scientific Method
1. Problem Statement Mission: To identify mosquitos that have the west nile virus.
2. Through exploratory data analysis we can estimate the number of infected mosquitos,
this will give us a good idea of infection rate for the testing data
3. Given the data, we can hypothesize where mosquitos infected with west nile virus will be present in Chicago



# Project Planning
1. Our ultimate deliverable is to predict if the west nile virus is present in a batch of mosquitos
2. (In progress)
3. Formulate the final deliverable, acquire and explore the data, clean the data, pick the correct model,
fit the model to the data, refine and predict.
